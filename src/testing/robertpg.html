        <div class='downthehead'>Named by the Calgary Herald in 2007 as a “Compelling Calgarian” to watch, Tonii Roulston 
has since built a reputation as a tough criminal lawyer known for her strategic thinking and 
effectiveness in the courtroom. Devoting her entire legal career of 21 years to defending 
people charged with criminal offences, Tonii Roulston’s career has been defined by taking 
on a variety of tough and high-profile cases. She defends the rights of clients who are 
accused of the most serious charges such as murder and sexual assaults, but also a range 
from domestic assaults to firearm charges. She recently successfully defended the rights 
of a young man charged with refusal while driving a tractor in the Didsbury area.
<br></br>
Currently, Tonii conducts about 2-3 homicide trials per year to ensure she can devote time 
to all the clients who have put their trust in her. She considers every charge she defends 
just as serious, as the consequences to the client can have a lasting impact.
<br></br>
Tonii’s experience in high profile cases and her vast experience with serious charges, gives 
her a unique perspective to ensure that she will develop a strategic plan for success in 
your case, no matter what you have been charged with.</div>
